      <p>
        Hi, I'm Zeraiz Shabbir, a recent Computer Science graduate based in Atlanta, GA. With a 
        GPA of 3.89 (magna cum laude), I have been recognized on the President's List four 
        times and the Dean's List once. I am eager to apply my skills in front-end development 
        and create user-friendly applications that make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main areas of focus include software development, UI/UX design, and leveraging 
        technologies like Java, Dart, and Python. Through my academic projects, such as 
        <strong> TinyTask</strong> and <strong>Budget Planner</strong>, I honed my ability to work in teams, 
        manage Agile workflows, and deliver high-quality software solutions. I thrive in 
        collaborative environments and pay meticulous attention to detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I may not have formal work experience yet, I am passionate about learning and 
        growing in the tech industry. In my free time, you can find me cooking up new recipes, 
        weightlifting, or diving into a good book. I'm excited to start my journey and connect 
        with others in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's create something amazing together!
